Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

In Lab 1 the assignement was to go over the basics of HTML and CSS so that students can become familer with what coding software we would be using. After that we were instructed to download Git and GitHub in order to move and commit any code we make through the assignemtn and the rest of the sememster.</p>

<p>Once Students had finally downloaded all the correct programs the next step was to go over each programs tutroial on how to use the software correctly. Once all the tutorials have been completed we were then instructed to create our own website using HTML. Some of the instructions were to either set up links to other websites, or to create text for the header, title, and body of the webpage. The final step of our homework was to custumize our webpage with CSS. Once that was completed we then uploaded our work to our new Github accounts and link that account to the homework page as well as anything else we had made for the homework.</p>

Of course we had to go through a short little tutorial on how bootstrap works. Just like last weeks assignment we have to use HTML to make a website, however unlike last week we are not using CSS to customize the webpage. Instead we had to pick a bootstrap theme and download that theme onto our computers.</p>

<p>Once we have found a theme to our liking we then had to change the website to make it more personal and about ourselves. We had to change certian aspects like inserting our own photos, changing the pre-generated text to something that actually makes sense, including the class name and picture of the red fox of Marist. Once we have completed our website we were then launch our website on GitPages. Once we have uploaded our new webpage to our Gitpage we were told to copy the link into Ilearn for submission.</p>

To me Technology presents a world of endless possiblites as we are alway on the look out for new techniques to further improve what we already have. That is why I always loved computers, even if I can not do it myself what computer can accomplish is just short of insanity.</p>

<p>Another Hobby of mine is Anime. I love anime so much that when I was in Rockland Community College I became the president of the Digital Entertainment Club. While it was not easy organizing everyone during it was an absolute blast to be apart of. Some of my favorite anime include Assassination Classroom, Dr. Stone, My Hero Academia, and many more. Currenlty im watch Black Summor and Overlord as they are currently in season.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kieran Scanlon</name></author><category term="About" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a long time now I have always loved Technology and most relating to it.
